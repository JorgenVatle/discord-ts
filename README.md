# Discord Webhook Types
Predefined TypeScript types and documentation for Discord webhook requests.

This package contains type definitions for all properties you can pass to a 
[Discord webhook execution request](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook#execute-webhook), 
along with descriptions for each property.

## Installation
Pull in the package from npm:
```bash
npm install discord-webhook-ts
``` 

## Usage
Pull in and attach the [`DiscordWebhook`](types/Webhook/index.d.ts) interface to your request object.
```typescript
import DiscordWebhook from 'discord-webhook-ts';

const requestBody: DiscordWebhook = {
    embeds: [
            {
                title: 'Some title',
                description: 'Some description',
            },
            {
                fields: [
                    {
                        name: 'Some field',
                        value: 'Some field value',
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
} 
```
